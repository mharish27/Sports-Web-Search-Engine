	"text": "\nFour teams will play twice in Double Gameweek 27 of Fantasy Premier League (FPL) after the rearrangement of two previously postponed fixtures. Brentford, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace and Southampton are the clubs involved, with their new Gameweek 27 schedules as follows:\nBrentford\u2019s double-header immediately catches the eye, with both opponents currently inside the Premier League\u2019s bottom three. Brighton, meanwhile, face a trip to Elland Road before hosting rivals Crystal Palace, who they happen to meet on Saturday in the reverse fixture. However, it\u2019s worth noting both sides will blank in Gameweek 25, due to Newcastle United and Manchester United\u2019s involvement in the EFL Cup final. That will temper any immediate enthusiasm, although as soon as that blank passes, expect interest in the likes of \n (\u00a37.7m) \u2013 providing he is still available \u2013 and \n (\u00a35.2m) to pick up. At that stage, the status of Blank Gameweek 28 will be clearer, too. As it stands, Brentford, Brighton and Southampton\u2019s fixtures are all at risk of being postponed. Mitoma\u2019s stock will only rise but Brighton could potentially face the following schedule, making it extremely difficult for FPL managers to navigate. As for Crystal Palace and Southampton, it\u2019s unlikely their assets will be afforded too much attention given their schedules, unless they can quickly find some form. Posted by"

	"text": "\nThe anytime goalscorer odds are based on the assumption that the player starts, so \n (\u00a312.2m) is top with a 66% chance of netting anytime over his two games. Aston Villa are up first for him, who have conceded 20 big chances since Gameweek 17 \u2013 they cannot afford to let any fall to Haaland. (\u00a36.8m) has a 53.5% chance and \n (\u00a38.3m) is on 39.5%. Only Haaland himself has registered a higher expected goals (xG) total than Nketiah since Gameweek 17, with 4.86 slightly behind 5.07. Following the Premier League\u2019s announcement of Double Gameweek 25, managers need to be tripled up on Arsenal assets and it\u2019s a week where Manchester City participate, while Brighton and Hove Albion, Brentford, Manchester United and Newcastle United do not. So you can buy some\u00a0extra short-term fixtures with smart transfers such as \n (\u00a37.7m) to Nketiah or \n (\u00a35.7m) to \n (\u00a37.0m). (\u00a312.7m) and \n (\u00a38.7m) aren\u2019t to be bought this week, given the Double Gameweek prioritisation, but are among those confirmed to have a Double Gameweek 25, so we\u2019ve got a couple of weeks to assess them. There could be an upturn in form once \n (\u00a38.0m), \n (\u00a38.8m) and \n (\u00a36.5m) return, which times perfectly with the double. The question is what to do with \n (\u00a36.6m), who is given a 38.5% chance of scoring but could be prone to more substitutions with \n (\u00a36.7m) around, like at Everton last weekend. He didn\u2019t even reach 60 minutes. For me, it\u2019s very justifiable to move Martinelli on to Odegaard or Saka, even for a four-point hit. Having two doubles over the next three means making sure you\u2019ve got the right players. The picture is clearer with Arsenal, whereas picking the best Man City trio is murkier. (\u00a37.7m) has a 47% chance of scoring and perhaps he\u2019s the one, given his recent form, though he also was an early substitution victim last week. Although \n (\u00a312.4m) was benched at Spurs, I\u2019d back him to start both matches and he\u2019s my favourite after Haaland. One problem is that, if you don\u2019t own him and pick him up now, you may only get two Gameweeks out of him before selling for Salah in Gameweek 25."

	"text": "One problem is that, if you don\u2019t own him and pick him up now, you may only get two Gameweeks out of him before selling for Salah in Gameweek 25. Fine if the rest of your team is set up well but one to weigh up if you\u2019ve got bench issues to work on beforehand. For the clean sheet odds, Man City and Arsenal are backed to keep at least one clean sheet, with 64.8% and 60% respectively. You\u2019d back the champions to do it versus Aston Villa, as Arsenal host Brentford. (\u00a34.7m) is the eighth top-scoring defender. Although it could be a concern that he is sometimes withdrawn early, this can be a good thing for defenders if it locks in the clean sheet. Yet we\u2019ve also seen a substitution before 60 minutes. Performance levels have dipped slightly in recent games, so \n (\u00a34.2m) could get a start at some point. That said, if you\u2019re a White owner, you probably stick with him for now. The best pick in my eyes is \n (\u00a35.2m), who is completely nailed and carries a goal threat. This season, he\u2019s top amongst all defenders for xG, scoring twice this season after the five of last time. There\u2019s not much between him and \n (\u00a35.3m), though. Left-back \n (\u00a35.1m) has been outstanding and is also worth some thought for \u00a35.1m, though again perhaps there\u2019s a small chance of some \n (\u00a34.6m) instead. They are very different types of defenders though, as Zinchenko cuts inside to overload central midfield, while Tierney is a more traditional attacking full-back that stays wider and gets down the wing. Newcastle have a 47% chance of a clean sheet at Bournemouth. It\u2019s their last good fixture for a while, depending on how you view Liverpool (H). Then it\u2019s Blank Gameweek 25, before visiting Man City. Despite that, there\u2019s quite rightly been no discussion on selling the incredible value of \n (\u00a36.1m). If you own the \n (\u00a34.6m) and \n(\u00a34.0m) pair, it\u2019s Kepa getting the nod this week, with a 34% chance of success compared to Ward\u2019s 21%. This week\u2019s top transfer is actually \n (\u00a35.2m) after 280,000 transfers in."

	"text": "This week\u2019s top transfer is actually \n (\u00a35.2m) after 280,000 transfers in. In isolation, he\u2019s a great pick after delivering four goals and an assist over his last five matches. However, without a Double Gameweek 23 before his blank in 25, it\u2019s not the week to buy him unless the rest of your team is perfect. After Mitoma, a lot of reasonable transfers have taken place. Saka has been picked up by 205,000, with seven goals and eight assists alongside the appeal of being nailed on and having penalty duties. If you can only pick one of Odegaard and Saka, I\u2019d lean towards Odegaard due to the price difference. Post-restart, Saka leads 2-0 on big chances but Odegaard is 4-1 up for big chances created and has a better expected goal involvement (xGI, 2.91 v 2.79). Over the season, xGI is still very close \u2013 9.4 for Saka but 9.7 for Odegaard. It\u2019s also worth keeping Gameweek 25\u2019s captaincy in the back of your mind, with Salah or an Arsenal player being the obvious picks. Saka\u2019s been widely discussed for the armband but is only on one double-digit haul this season, compared to Odegaard\u2019s six. If you own both or can get to both for this week, you\u2019re in a very strong position. We saw a lot of FPL managers sell De Bruyne for \n (\u00a39.9m) last week and now 105,000 have bought the Belgian. The addition of Double Gameweek 25 has altered the situation, as you could grab De Bruyne for two weeks and then sell for Salah is in good shape elsewhere, or you could skip Salah entirely. If you\u2019re looking for a Man City defender, \n (\u00a35.0m) could maybe be the best option if Pep Guardiola persists with the back-three formation but it is close between him and \n (\u00a35.1m). He may deploy one of Ake or \n (\u00a35.7m) as the left-footed centre-back, with two right-footers like Akanji and \n (\u00a35.9m). The injury to \n (\u00a35.4m) means one less player is competing for that position, though he could be back by Gameweek 25 and put Akanji slightly at risk. The upside with Ake is that he carries more attacking threat."

If you wish to move him to another Man City defender then Akanji and Ake are my picks, in that order, although we did see \n (\u00a33.9m) play the full 90 last match for the first time. Almiron is the second most-sold after dropping off substantially since the World Cup. The seven matches before saw seven goals and two assists but the six after has just one goal, all the way back in Gameweek 17. Martinelli has 159,000 sales, with growing concern over Trossard\u2019s presence. The next three Gameweeks need managers to have the exact right Arsenal assets. The frustrating Salah has been sold by 119,000 but is probably worth holding now that Double Gameweek 25 has been announced. Finally, it\u2019s a surprise to see De Bruyne here, sold by 69,000 managers. I\u2019d back him to start both games this week. Posted by"

	"text": "\nDouble Gameweek 23 of Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is fast approaching, so it\u2019s time to have a look at some more differential options. This time, we\u2019ve selected low-owned picks at Chelsea, Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who we think have the potential to make an impact. As always, to qualify, the player must have an ownership of 5% or less at the time of writing. It may have gone under the radar but Chelsea have kept a clean sheet in all three of \n\u2019s (\u00a35.0m) appearances so far. The Frenchman has played just 270 minutes for his new club after signing from Monaco in January, yet he already looks like a shrewd acquisition, having struck up an impressive partnership with Thiago Silva (\u00a35.5m). Prior to his introduction into the starting XI, Graham Potter\u2019s side had kept just one clean sheet across their last eight Premier League outings. With him in the team, they have managed to shut out Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Fulham. In Gameweek 22, Fulham attacked whenever opportunities presented themselves but were repeatedly left frustrated by the host\u2019s defensive organisation. In fact, Marco Silva\u2019s side managed just five shots inside the box and 0.65 expected goals (xG) overall, their lowest tally in a single match since the Premier League resumed after the World Cup. Chelsea added eight players to their ranks last month, but, per UEFA rules, could only register three of these signings (Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix and Enzo Fernandez) in their Champions League squad for the knockout stages, with Badiashile missing out. However, that suggests he could play a key part in their Premier League schedule, which includes guaranteed fixtures in Gameweeks 25 and 28. All is not rosy at Chelsea right now, especially in attack, but it\u2019s worth noting they have kept seven clean sheets since Potter took charge in Gameweek 9, second only to Newcastle United\u2019s nine. Their underlying defensive stats in the last six matches continue to improve, too, as they sit sixth for minutes per expected goals conceded (xGC). That makes Badiashile an intriguing differential pick, who can not only help FPL managers navigate the forthcoming blanks but also offer real value at \u00a35.0m."

	"text": "That makes Badiashile an intriguing differential pick, who can not only help FPL managers navigate the forthcoming blanks but also offer real value at \u00a35.0m. Having only recently returned from injury, \n (\u00a38.0m) scored Leicester\u2019s early equaliser at Villa Park last weekend. The 26-year-old played as a second striker at times, often joining Kelechi Iheanacho (\u00a36.1m) in the initial press. However, he would also come short, with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 attacking 4-4-2 formation morphing into a 4-3-3. It certainly worked, with the Foxes scoring four goals in a match for the third time this season from an impressive 2.57 xG, the most of any side in Gameweek 22 bar Man Utd, who played twice. Tete (\u00a35.5m) and Iheanacho may have drawn most of the plaudits in Leicester\u2019s 4-2 win, but the former\u2019s arrival allows Maddison to move back to his preferred central position, which is arguably the key FPL takeaway from the match. Despite sometimes being used in an inverted midfield role from the right this season, Maddison is averaging 0.61 goals per 90 minutes, an impressive tally that is only beaten by six players who you\u2019d deem regular starters (500+ minutes). He\u2019s exceeded his xG by +4.76 (eight goals from 3.24 xG) thanks to his excellent long-range finishing, but even if that drops off, his playmaking skills can provide assists. The immediate fixtures for Leicester admittedly aren\u2019t that appealing, but Maddison has scored in his last two meetings with Spurs. He also netted against Arsenal earlier in the season and despite blanking, racked up three shots/two created chances when the Foxes met Man Utd in September. Maddison\u2019s return from injury has been a huge boost for Leicester, who are unbeaten in the three games he has played in 2023. Now, you\u2019d expect them to kick on and provide real Fantasy value for the remainder of the season. Budget defender \n (\u00a34.3m) gave his best display of the season in Gameweek 22, partnering Craig Dawson (\u00a34.8m) at the back in Wolves\u2019 3-0 win over Liverpool. As a result, the Molineux outfit have now taken 10 points from the last 18 available, a decent tally for a team still acclimatising to Julen Lopetegui\u2019s methods."

In fact, they have conceded only six goals from Gameweek 17 onwards, the same number as\u00a0Arsenal, whilst keeping two clean sheets. \u201c[Lopetegui] has made massive changes, to our mentality, our way to work, to press, to be on the pitch and this was very good for us and we are very happy to work with him.

You can then bench him against Spurs and Newcastle, which needn\u2019t be an issue given his \u00a34.3m price tag. Up first for Wolves is Southampton, who lost 3-0 at Brentford last time out, a result which leaves them bottom of the division. That was Nathan Jones\u2019 sixth defeat from seven league games in charge, a period that has seen them score just five goals, so there is real clean-sheet potential for Wolves this weekend. Owned by just 1.9% of managers, Kilman could be the perfect budget enabler at Wolves, at a time when team-mate Hugo Bueno\u2019s (\u00a33.9m) minutes are perhaps in doubt. Posted by"

De Bruyne is expected to return to the starting line-up against both Aston Villa and Arsenal who, unlike Spurs, typically play a more traditional back-four formation. The Belgian was sprung for the bench just before the 60\n minute against Spurs and created a match-leading three chances, highlighting the playmaker\u2019s potential. De Bruyne\u2019s 19 chances created, six big chances supplied, and 15 successful crosses all play in the division\u2019s top three over the last six matches \u2013 which suggests that returns will come for City\u2019s underperformer.

A secure starting role and Mahrez\u2019s natural ability are a potent combination, and City\u2019s winger highlighted his high-ceiling potential in Double Gameweek 20. Mahrez scored two goals and supplied an assist against Tottenham Hotspur delivering a 17-point haul in the second fixture. Since the return to domestic action, Mahrez has registered seven attacking returns, netting three times and turning provider on four occasions, and the Algerian\u2019s point tally (46) over that period is just two fewer than Erling Haaland. The underlying numbers highlight Mahrez\u2019s all-round potential with his nine shots in the box, 15 chances created, and five big chances supplied all placing in the top three among City teammates since Gameweek 17.

	"text": "\nWe assess the key Fantasy Premier League (FPL) talking points from two Gameweek 23 matches, Arsenal v Brentford and Bournemouth v Newcastle United. The numbers you see in this article are taken from our\u00a0\n, where you can access Opta player and team data for every single Premier League fixture. (\u00a36.6m) blanked for the fifth match in a row on Saturday, being hooked around the hour mark for the second Gameweek running as replacement \n (\u00a36.7m) came off the bench to score. All this clock-watching isn\u2019t good for the health and the fact that Martinelli\u2019s owners were just relieved to see the 60-minute mark pass before his withdrawal, in order to see him pick up two extra points, shows how much his appeal has been dented recently. \u201cNot particularly bad but a long way off his scintillating best. Looks to be missing Gabriel Jesus.\u201d \u2013 Football London\u2019s write-up of Gabriel Martinelli\u2019s performance\nMartinelli wasn\u2019t atrocious, as the succinct summary above points out, but he\u2019s now got the misfortune of being one of the only Arsenal regulars with a top-class back-up/positional rival waiting in the wings. Since Trossard\u2019s arrival, Martinelli has played 200 minutes to \n\u2018s (\u00a38.3m) 270. It was Saka who provided the assist for Trossard\u2019s goal, with the England international\u2019s six FPL points feeling like a good return in this low-scoring Gameweek so far. The winger also had more shots (seven) than Martinelli, \n(\u00a37.0m) and a quiet \n (\u00a36.8m) put together. \u201cI think every player has got their moment. We took Gabi off for Leo because when Leo\u2019s in those spaces, he\u2019s so good. He\u2019s so composed, he\u2019s constantly faking movements, playing forwards, he\u2019s got a smell for where the ball is going to land, and we believe it was the right choice to get him on today.\u201d \u2013 Mikel Arteta on Gabriel Martinelli\nMikel Arteta has kept unenforced changes to an absolute minimum this season, with Martinelli, Saka and Odegaard among the 10 Gunners who\u2019ve started every league match that they\u2019ve been available for. After the game, the Arsenal boss was asked whether he is considering the possibility of fatigue creeping in without any rotation in the line-up:\n\u201cWe always thought about that, and with a few players, especially when you lose but those questions are always obviously when you drop a point or two points."

I\u2019m delighted to be fair with how the boys tried, how much they want it. With the players that we have, we try to maximise our resources, so far they\u2019ve done really well.\u201d \u2013 Mikel Arteta\nArsenal did rack up more shots than any other Premier League team on Saturday (23) but few of them were clear-cut, with Trossard\u2019s goal the only \u2018big chance\u2019 logged by Opta. however, an in-form, unbeaten-in-ten Brentford have become a tough nut to crack, and much easier tests await the Gunners in the weeks and months to come. Don\u2019t press the panic button just yet. Brentford have now scored against all seven of the teams above them in the league table this season, with \n(\u00a37.6m) plundering eight goals of his own against these clubs \u2013 that\u2019s over half of his 2022/23 total. The in-form Bees now don\u2019t encounter any big-six side until Gameweek 33, unless their outstanding fixture against Manchester United is added to the schedule before then. Their upcoming \u2018double\u2019 in Gameweek 27 is also hugely enticing, although there is that pesky blank in Gameweek 25 and \nOne other thing that\u2019s worth mentioning is that Toney was spotted rubbing his hamstring when being substituted late in the game at the Emirates, although this could well have been part of the gamesmanship/dark arts \nNewcastle extended their unbeaten run to 17 league matches but it was another uninspiring draw for the Magpies, their fifth in six matches \u2013 four of which have been against sides in the bottom half. Bournemouth arguably merited the victory more, too, with\n (\u00a36.1m) clearing off the line late on to preserve a point. \u201cA\u00a0lot of effort\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0quality. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few half-chances but we lacked that killer instinct today, we weren\u2019t as free flowing in the final third as we have\u00a0been.\u201d \u2013 Eddie Howe\nThe impact of \n(\u00a35.6m) absence \nand Eddie Howe\u2019s side were again below par at both ends of the field at the Vitality Stadium."

It\u2019d be human nature to have one eye on the upcoming EFL Cup final, too, and the subconscious or conscious bid to avoid injury for a rare old trip to Wembley. That didn\u2019t stop the fitness issues from racking up on Saturday evening. Newcastle went into the game without \n(\u00a37.1m) because of a hamstring strain, while the Magpies lost \n (\u00a34.7m), \n (\u00a35.7m) and \n (\u00a36.1m) to hamstring, wrist and knee injuries respectively during the match. Luckily for Howe and his thin Newcastle squad, only Willock\u2019s problem seems to be causing concern. \u201cMiggy and Maxi I don\u2019t think are too bad. Miggy, I think got a stamp on his hand, so I think he\u2019ll be OK. Maxi, I think, was just a knock. The concern from today is Joe Willock who has a hamstring problem. We\u2019ll see how he is. \u201cCallum\u2019s just got a very minor hamstring complaint. We hope to get him back for the next one. Fingers crossed.\u201d \u2013 Eddie Howe\nAlmiron was the most-sold FPL midfielder of Gameweek 23 and there was an inevitability that he would end his five-match points drought, although wounded sellers will still point to the fact that his equalising goal against Bournemouth was his only shot of the game and his first \u2018big chance\u2019 in six Gameweeks. As for the Cherries, there have been three improved performances in a row now, helped by some fresh acquisitions and the return from injury of some key names. Only a late, late Brighton goal in Gameweek 22 has stopped them from stringing together a three-match unbeaten run. But only rabid Bournemouth fans will be snapping up their players for the upcoming run, so the few mentions of them in FPL circles will chiefly concern how much of a whipping boy we think they still are for our prospective Gameweek 25-27 captains."

Arrows before the name indicate whether a player has climbed or fallen in our reckoning since the previous update or if they are a new entry into the tables. We typically toe the line with FPL\u2019s definition of \u2018form\u2019 (average points accrued in matches played over the last 30 days) but with few matches actually played over that time, we\u2019ve extended it slightly back to the beginning of 2023. The key for the factors you\u2019ll see in the below tables is as follows:\nDespite goalkeepers doubling all around him, \n (\u00a34.6m) climbs back to the top of the pecking order and may well remain there for much of the run-in. He had only dropped down due to a recent \u2018tough\u2019 run of games (Manchester City, Liverpool and two encounters with a formerly free-scoring Fulham) but he\u2019s a set-and-forget dream for the medium term, with seven of Chelsea\u2019s next eight fixtures against sides in the bottom half. Even better, Kepa \u2013 who averages more points per match (5.6) than any other regular starter between the sticks \u2013 plays for one of just seven clubs who\ndon\u2019t blank in Gameweeks 25 and 28. Sheer volume of fixtures \u2013 eight in the next six Gameweeks \u2013 is the driving force behind \n\u2018s (\u00a34.9m) climb to second, even if he\u2019s not in the shake-up of most FPL managers\u2019 Arsenal triple-ups. Nevertheless, he\u2019s a country mile ahead of other shot-stoppers for \nin Gameweeks 23-28."
